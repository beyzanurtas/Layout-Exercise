# Layout-Exercise
First we downloaded our resource from [this site](https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/4762-design-courses-app-sketch-freebie-resource.html). Then we imported the downloaded resource to [Figma](https://www.figma.com). We tried to make the designs closest to the UI designs in Figma. Our main responsibility was to make the layout designs. In addition to this, in this project, you can see the *page transitions* and the bonus *Sign up* page that I added because I don't want the *Sign up* text to be blank.
